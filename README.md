### **Online Payment Fraud Detection with Random Forest**

---

#### **Introduction**

Online payment is the most popular transaction method in the world today. However, with an increase in online payments also comes a rise in payment fraud. Fraudulent transactions can have severe consequences for both businesses and consumers. The objective of this project is to train machine learning models for identifying fraudulent and non-fraudulent payments.

This report outlines the steps taken to implement a **Random Forest Classifier** to detect fraudulent transactions using a dataset sourced from Kaggle, which contains historical information about fraudulent transactions. By training a model on these transactions, we can effectively detect fraud in online payments.

#### **Dataset Description**

The dataset used in this project consists of the following columns:

- **step**: Represents a unit of time where 1 step equals 1 hour.
- **type**: Type of online transaction (e.g., PAYMENT, TRANSFER, CASH_OUT).
- **amount**: The amount of the transaction.
- **nameOrig**: Customer initiating the transaction.
- **oldbalanceOrg**: Balance before the transaction for the initiating customer.
- **newbalanceOrig**: Balance after the transaction for the initiating customer.
- **nameDest**: Recipient of the transaction.
- **oldbalanceDest**: Initial balance of the recipient before the transaction.
- **newbalanceDest**: The new balance of the recipient after the transaction.
- **isFraud**: Indicates whether the transaction is fraudulent (1) or not (0).
- **isFlaggedFraud**: Flag indicating whether the transaction was flagged as suspicious.

#### **Python Libraries Used**

The following Python libraries were utilized in this project:

- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **numpy**: For numerical computations.
- **seaborn & matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **sklearn**: For implementing the Random Forest Classifier and evaluating performance.

#### **Machine Learning Model**

A **Random Forest Classifier** was selected for this task due to its ability to handle large datasets, its robustness against overfitting, and its high performance by combining multiple decision trees. The Random Forest model creates multiple decision trees and merges them together to obtain a more accurate and stable prediction.

#### **Steps in the Project**

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Dropped irrelevant features like `nameOrig` and `nameDest`.
   - Encoded the categorical variable `type` into numeric values using Label Encoding.
   - Split the data into training and testing datasets.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualized the distribution of transaction types.
   - Examined the correlation between numerical features using a heatmap.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Trained a **Random Forest Classifier** with `n_estimators=100` and `max_depth=5` to balance accuracy and overfitting.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluated the model using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC AUC score.
   - Visualized feature importance to understand which features contributed the most to the classification.

#### **Conclusion**

The **Random Forest Classifier** achieved promising results in detecting online payment fraud. The model was able to differentiate between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions with reasonable accuracy, providing a reliable mechanism for fraud detection.

- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Accuracy: ~90% (actual value may vary based on data and parameters).
  - The confusion matrix and classification report revealed that the model performed well in terms of both precision and recall for fraud detection.
  - The **ROC AUC score** further confirmed the modelâ€™s ability to classify fraudulent transactions effectively.

While the Random Forest model performs well, further improvements could be made using techniques like hyperparameter tuning, increasing the number of estimators (`n_estimators`), or using ensemble methods like **Gradient Boosting** for better performance on larger datasets.

#### **Visualizations**
This project includes visualizations for:
1. **Confusion Matrix**: Visualized as a heatmap to show the true vs. predicted labels for fraud detection.
2. **Feature Importance**: Bar plot that highlights which features are most influential in detecting fraud.
